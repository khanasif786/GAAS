# Ground Control Station for Autonomous Flying Cars

### These stations are placed with a pattern of cellular. Just like the way your mobile phone and its base stations work.

#####    Each station contains some small hexagons. Each hexagon contains multiple layers with different height.

#####    When a vehicle try to plan its path: the stations in this path are involved, and hexagons with a certain altitude(in other words, 3d cellulars) are distributed to this vehicle by these stations. If path is generated successfully by stations, these 3d cellulars are set status "occupied", which will be maintained by these stations.

# 自动飞行汽车地面控制站

### 这些地面被蜂窝状放置.如同你的手机使用的基站一样.

##### 每个站负责一块小六边形区域.每个区域有多个层

##### 当空中载具尝试规划路径时,经过的基站参与这一过程.小六边形块对应的高度层被分配给这些空中载具.如果路径生成成功,这些带高度的小六边形块在地面基站里被标记为已占据.
